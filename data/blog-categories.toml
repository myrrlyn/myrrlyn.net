["How Computers Work"]

["Type Theory"]
summary = """
While I have no formal education in the algebra behind type theory, I have just
enough education in set theory and experience in typed languages that I have
elected to risk making a fool of myself talking about it anyway.

I will be using examples from programming languages in which I actively work, so
largely C and Rust. I don’t speak any languages with more intricate type
systems, which is no doubt limiting what I’m able to express.

These are often drawn directly from my experience at work.
