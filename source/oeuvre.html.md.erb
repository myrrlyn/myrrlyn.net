I’ve been writing in the *Elder Scrolls* universe since the fall or so of 2012.
I started out in the Tamriel Scholars’ Guild roleplaying group on reddit, though
I believe it’s long since defunct. I’m not sure if the subreddit is accessible
anymore; my own posts and comments aren’t deleted if for some ungodly reason you
want to trawl my profile for them.

I think I’m batting close to a thousand on my /r/teslore posts being listed in
their Compendium. Anyting of mine not in there probably isn’t worth reading, in
all honesty.

The magic of having my own website means I get to present my texts as I please.
To that end, here’s everything I’m hosting, sorted by date of publication. The
nav section (right on desktop, down on mobile) is sorted alphabetically by tags.

<% blog.articles.sort { |a,b| a.date <=> b.date }.each do |post| %>
1. [<%= post.title %>](<%= canonicalize post.url %>){:.title}
<% end %>

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<aside id="about-text">
I should probably note that many of my texts are classified as “apocryphal”,
that is, making up new things rather than analyzing existing lore. It’s totally
fine to reject apocrypha, and whether or not you add my works to your perception
of Tamriel is entirely up to you.
