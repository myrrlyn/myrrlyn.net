# 403 Forbidden

My server setup is a little weird in order to have “pretty” URLs that don’t end
in “.html”.

If you’re seeing this page because of a link you’re expecting to work, and it
ends in a slash, try removing the final slash.

If it redirects you back here, swap the final slash for a “.html” and that
should do it.

Sorry.

Self-hosting is hard. Don’t be like me; use a professional.
