# About Me

I was born and raised in rural Minnesota, about an hour southwest of the Twin
Cities. I’ve always displayed a natural thirst for knowledge, especially about
music, mathematics, and computing, and my parents encouraged the pursuit of
education both in and out of the classroom. Living in the country provided
opportunities to learn about carpentry (my dad was a hobbyist cabinetmaker, and
we also had to do a ***lot*** of upkeep on the property) and the outdoors with
the Boy Scouts.

My family moved to Michigan in 2005. I completed my Eagle Scout Service Project
in 2008, which reintroduced bluebirds to my local county for the first time in
over twenty years. I attended Trine University, originally as a Mechanical
Engineer. When I realized I was much more passionate about the programming and
machine control than by the finished products, I switched to Computer
Engineering. My Senior Design project, the construction and programming of a
large autonomous vehicle, involved my skills in both disciplines.

In addition to my academic and technical pursuits, I also greatly enjoy music
and aquatics. I began learning piano when I was six, and added the trumpet and
French horn in middle and high school, respectively. I’ve played in my school
bands for ten years and would like to continue in a community orchestra wherever
I wind up. I have been a strong swimmer all my life, and became a Red Cross
lifeguard at 14. My passion for aquatic safety has led me to become a BSA
lifeguard and PADI Rescue Diver, and I have employed these skills as the
aquatics director at a local Boy Scout camp. During my time at Rota-Kiwan, I
received excellent reviews and maintained a strong safety record.

I am deeply passionate about achieving safety in risky environments through
familiarity, competence, and assistance. I aim to make delivery of such safety
benefits a primary goal of my career and personal life.

# Personal Life

As I am one of the few young, unmarried, engineers at my company, I have found
myself receiving the travel assignments that my coworkers’ families don’t want
to bear. As such, I moved from Michigan to Utah to start my job and then,
eighteen months later, transferred to Albuquerque. I expect to be moved at least
twice more in the next five years as my career and our work grow.

I served as an assistant scoutmaster for Troop 1 while I lived in Logan, Utah,
and I hope to resume that post upon my eventual return. I am not sure how
involved in Scouting I will be while on my travel rotation. As I am not LDS or
a university student, my options for in-person socializing are significantly
curtailed.

I am very excited about all the new geography to explore around me, as well as
the multitude of national parks near by. So far I’ve only been to Arches,
Yellowstone, and Grand Teton National Parks, but I am far too Boy Scout to hold
out on all the rest for long.

# Career Goals

I’m almost two years into my first job at [Space Dynamics Laboratory][SDL], and
I’m very happy with both the work I’m doing and the company culture there. I
currently don’t have any plans to search for new jobs or move away from wherever
SDL has me stationed.

I am interested in the [Rust] programming language for its memory safety and
performance characteristics, both of which are rather important in aerospace
work. Rust isn’t *quite* ready to displace C/C++ in flight software, as it uses
LLVM, which has fewer targets than GCC, and it is not yet readily integrable with
build systems like CMake.

I’d like to start getting Rust’s foot in the door in my workplace, including if
necessary (and possible for me to do…) contributing to Rust in areas that we
identify it as needing work.
