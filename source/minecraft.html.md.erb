# Overview

I run a lightly modded Minecraft server. Chances are that if you can read this
page, the server is alive and well. Aim your Minecraft at `myrrlyn.net`.

The server is currently running Minecraft v1.10.2 with the following server-side
mods:

- Minecraft Forge <%= mcver %> - <%= mcfver %>
- IndustrialCraft<sup>2</sup> <%= ic2ver %>

You *must* install these two mods in order to connect.

## Access

The server is presently whitelisted. Chances are that if you can read this, you
have a means of reaching me. Send me your username and I’ll open the gates.

## Mod Installation

1. Download the Forge installer appropriate to your system. You can find them at
the [Forge website][forge], and I am hosting copies of the correct version here.

    - [Windows installer][fw]: Download, tell your computer it’s safe, run.
    - [Mac/Linux installer][fl]: Download, run.

    You’ll want to install the client. When you next launch Minecraft, be sure
    you’re using the “Forge” profile, with this version selected.

2. Run Minecraft at least once to be sure Forge is correctly set up.

3. Download the [IndustrialCraft<sup>2</sup>][ic2] file and copy it to your mods
directory. ([IC<sup>2</sup> <%= ic2ver %>][ic2j])

    By default, Minecraft lives in these locations. The `mods` folder will be in
    here, after Minecraft has been run once with Forge installed.

    - Windows: `%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Local\.minecraft`
    - OS X / macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft`
    - Linux: `~/.minecraft`

4. Run Minecraft again. Verify that Forge sees IndustrialCraft<sup>2</sup>.

5. In the Multiplayer section, add my server (`myrrlyn.net`) and verify that
Forge reports it as compatible. If you used the files on this page and installed
them correctly, you should be all set.

6. Try to enter, and pester me if it fails.
