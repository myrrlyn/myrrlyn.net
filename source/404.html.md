# 404 Not Found
{:.text-center}

The page you requested could not be found.

I try to keep my URLs stable, though I fail from time to time. If you’re seeing
this because of a page that really should be working, it’s possible that there’s
a trailing slash in the URL causing problems.

Try removing that trailing slash and requesting again, or if that doesn’t work,
substituting the last slash for a “.html”. If *that* doesn’t work, the page is
likely gone.

Everything that’s present on my site *should* be reachable from the root page.
If there’s no path to where you’re trying to go (for instance, if you’re
following old links from things I had up years ago and haven’t yet rebuilt),
you’re out of luck, sorry.
