I’m Alexander Payne, a computer engineering graduate of Trine University, as
well as an Eagle Scout, lifeguard, scuba diver, and avid adventurer and student.

I love most anything related to programming, aquatics, building new projects, or
exploring new places.

I am currently unemployed and living in southern central Michigan. I’m taking
this time to continue to broaden my education as I look for work. While I would
most like to work in the Midwest, I am willing and able to relocate anywhere if
needed. I have experience in embedded systems, system administration, and web
design, and am able to work anywhere in software development.
