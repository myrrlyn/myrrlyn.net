I’m Alexander Payne, a Computer Engineering graduate of Trine University. I am
also a doubly-certified professional lifeguard and PADI Rescue Diver.

I live in southern central Michigan, but I’m willing to move anywhere or travel
if a job requires that. I am available for hire, and am looking to work anywhere
in the software development field.

The Web has a complex relationship with data persistence. Web applications, a
term which is coming to encompass any website that attempts to be more than a
remote document viewer, require statefulness, and that needs to be stored either
by the client or by the server.

In my opinion, the client should be the default store for anything that isn’t a
security leak for the application. Browsers accomplish this task with cookies.

Unfortunately, cookies come with their own ways to leak privacy, and now there’s
a law which requires sites to disclose cookie usage. I have my own opinions on
the efficacy of this law, but I do agree with its sentiment.

I use cookies to enhance this site’s functionality. At the bottom of every page
is a button that will display the cookies that page can see, and another button
to destroy those cookies.

You are welcome to peruse the source code of my site if you wish to see how
cookies are used.
