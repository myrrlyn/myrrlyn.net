# Résumé

## Formal Education

**Trine University:** Angola, IN; August 2011 to May 2016. Bachelor of Science,
Computer Engineering.

Notable courses:

- ***Senior Design***: My capstone project was the construction and programming
of an autonomous cargo hauler. I worked with three mechanical engineers, and
worked on the electrical and software systems. The machine was able to navigate
along a pre-programmed route, and successfully detected obstacles such as
pedestrians and a train. The code is on my GitHub profile, and the summary video
is [on YouTube][srd].

- **Logic and Computer Design**: Focused on the hardware construction of a
computer and the instruction primitives executing on it. We built a MIPS CPU in
Verilog.

- **Embedded Systems**: We learned about real-time operating systems and OS-less
programming. We built an oscilloscope and primitive RTOS.

- **Software Engineering I and II**: Focused on development patterns, software
design, and algorithm use. We learned C++/Qt and Ruby, and built a Rails app and
primitive SQL database.

General courses:

- *Mathematics*: Calculus III, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Graph
Theory and Combinatorics, Statistics, Random Processes

- *Programming*: Object-Oriented Programming (Java), Application Programming
(C++/Qt), Computer Security (Java), Net-Centric Computing (PHP, C++), Algorithms
(C++, Python).

- *Electronic Systems*: Circuit Theory and Analysis, Digital Systems (Verilog),
Microcontrollers (C, Assembly).

Mechanical Engineering major (two years):

- Static Analysis, Solid Mechanics, Dynamic Systems
- Thermodynamics
- Kinematics and Mechanical Linkages
- Mechatronics

## Skills

I can quickly learn development environments, toolchains, and programming
languages. I also readily understand software abstracts such as algorithm
design, control flow, design patterns, and behavioral paradigms.

I taught myself the basics of programming and *NIX use before switching majors,
and continued to complement my formal education with individual pursuits and
projects. I’ve continued pursuing education on my own initiative, and have a
broad range of languages, tools, and systems with which I am capable of working.

### Languages

- English: I have an excellent command of English and technical communication.

- Ruby

    I taught myself Ruby before taking the computer engineering major, and
    continue to use it as my prototyping language. I am familiar with Ruby on
    Rails, and have written a few gems for my own personal use.

- Java

    I learned the basics of Java in high school, and pursued it further for
    my formal courses in it. I have a solid grasp on the Java standard library,
    but am only slightly familiar with Java tool systems such as Gradle and
    Maven.

- C, C++

    I am most familiar with the language cores, as I did most of my embedded
    work with little or no standard library presence. I am also familiar with
    the Qt framework, and have built both integrated and client/server
    applications using it.

    - AVR Assembly

        My embedded classes taught us to use ASM to start our chips, provide
        base drivers, and hand-optimize certain routines.

- Rust

    I had hoped to use Rust for my Senior Design project, but it could not yet
    target AVR. I have been teaching myself Rust and am reasonably capable in
    it. I am not yet fluent in its standard library, but I have a firm grasp on
    the language’s core principles.

- C♯:

    I taught myself C♯ and Visual Studio, and have used it to build console apps
    and ASP.NET websites. I have experimented with GUI apps, but am not well
    versed in the graphical libraries.

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript

    Self-taught. This site is hand-written, so that will be my testament to
    ability. I use Sass and TypeScript layers above CSS and JS.

#### Others

- Bash and Zsh scripting
- D
- Python
- AVR, x86 assembly

### Systems and Tools

- Windows

    I’ve used Windows all my life, and have some experience in basic system
    administration and Windows Server usage.

- Linux

    I started on Ubuntu, and now run Arch Linux as my daily-use system. I am
    comfortable working with GNU userspace tools on the command line, and have
    written several shell scripts and systemd units for system administration. I
    use Linux both as my desktop system and on my server.

- OSX / macOS

    I’m comfortable using Macintosh, but do not have any experience with
    administering it.

- Microsoft Office

    I’ve been using Word and Excel since I was in elementary school, am capable
    in Powerpoint, and dabbled in Access for database use.

- Git

    I learned Git in what I’m told is the hardest way: on a team project, with
    my partner in Texas, by experimentation. I have several years of experience
    using Git and have a firm understanding of its theory and actual usage.

- UNIX shells

    I use `zsh` as my daily shell, and am acquainted with `bash` as well.

- Editors/IDEs

    In order of decreasing familiarity and use:

    - Visual Studio
    - Atom and Visual Studio Code
    - Eclipse and NetBeans
    - Vim. I can type in and exit Vim, but that’s about it.

## Work Experience

I worked at Rota-Kiwan Scout Reservation over the summers during college, as a
lifeguard and then aquatics director. My responsibilities included:

- Recruiting and training staff
- Maintaining a safe area
- Managing area resources and personnel
- Managing campers
- Coordinating emergency response
- Delivering the customer experience (merit badges and fun) without compromising
safety

I received excellent reviews from the scouts, parents, and my management. My
technical capabilities are largely self-evident, from projects I’ve already done
and through any technical interviews. My abilities as an employee, team member,
and leader are less quantifiable. I can provide references to these effects upon
request.

## Professional Certifications and Associations

- American Red Cross
    - ARC Lifeguard
    - CPR and Emergency First Aid Provider
- Boy Scouts of America
