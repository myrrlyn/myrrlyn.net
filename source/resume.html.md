# Résumé

## Formal Education

**Trine University:** Angola, IN; August 2011 to May 2016. Bachelor of Science,
Computer Engineering.

Notable courses:

- ***Senior Design***: My capstone project was the construction and programming
of an autonomous cargo hauler. I worked with three mechanical engineers on the
physical machine, and personally built the electrical and software systems. The
machine capably navigated along a pre-programmed route, and successfully
detected obstacles such as pedestrians and a train. The code is on my GitHub
profile, and the summary video is [on YouTube][srd]. I can provide design
documents upon request.

- **Logic and Computer Design**: This class focused on the hardware construction
of a computer and the instruction primitives executing on it. We built a MIPS
CPU in Verilog.

- **Embedded Systems**: This class taught real-time operating systems and
OS-less programming. We built an oscilloscope and basic RTOS.

- **Software Engineering I and II**: These classes focused on development
patterns, software design, and algorithm use. We learned C++/Qt and Ruby, and
built a Rails app and SQL database.

General courses:

- *Mathematics*: Calculus III, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Graph
Theory and Combinatorics, Statistics, Random Processes

- *Programming*: Object-Oriented Programming (Java), Application Programming
(C++/Qt), Computer Security (Java), Net-Centric Computing (PHP, C++), Algorithms
(C++, Python).

- *Electronic Systems*: Circuit Theory and Analysis, Digital Systems (Verilog),
Microcontrollers (C, Assembly).

Mechanical Engineering major (two years):

- Static Analysis, Solid Mechanics, Dynamic Systems
- Thermodynamics
- Kinematics and Mechanical Linkages
- Mechatronics

## Skills

I rapidly master development environments, toolchains, and programming
languages. I also readily understand software abstract principles such as
algorithm design, flow of control, design patterns, and behavioral paradigms.

I taught myself the basics of programming and Linux use before switching majors,
and continued to complement my formal education with individual pursuits and
projects. I have continued pursuing education on my own initiative, and am
capable of working with a broad range of languages, tools, and systems.

### Languages

- English: I have an excellent command of English and technical communication.

- Ruby

    I taught myself Ruby before taking the computer engineering major, and
    continue to use it as my prototyping language. I am familiar with Ruby on
    Rails, and have written gems for public use.

- Java

    I learned the basics of Java in high school, and pursued it further for
    my formal courses in it. I have a solid grasp on the Java standard library,
    and am familiar with Java tool systems such as Gradle and Maven.

- C, C++

    I am most familiar with the language cores, as I did most of my embedded
    work with little or no standard library presence. I am also familiar with
    the Qt framework, and have built both integrated and client/server
    applications using it.

    - AVR Assembly

        My embedded classes taught us to use ASM to start our controllers,
        implement base drivers, and hand-optimize certain routines.

- Rust

    I investigated using Rust for my Senior Design project. I taught myself Rust
    and am fluent in its core concepts.

- C♯:

    I taught myself C♯ and Visual Studio, and have used them to build console
    apps and ASP.NET websites. I have also used the graphical frameworks to
    build applications.

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript

    I taught myself web design, and volunteered to help my professor teach these
    languages for my Software Engineering classes. I write this site myself, and
    offer it as a testament to my ability.

#### Others

- Bash and Zsh scripting
- D
- Python
- AVR, x86 assembly

### Systems and Tools

- Windows

    I’ve used Windows all my life, and have experience in system administration
    and Windows Server usage.

- Linux

    I started on Ubuntu, and now run Arch Linux as my daily-use system. I am
    comfortable working with GNU userspace tools on the command line. I have
    written several shell scripts and systemd units for system administration. I
    use Linux both as my desktop system and on my server.

- OSX / macOS

    I am comfortable using Macintosh’s graphical and terminal environments.

- Microsoft Office

    I have used Word, Excel, and Outlook since elementary school, and am
    proficient in their use. I am skilled with Powerpoint and familiar with
    Access.

- Git

    I learned Git the hardest way: on a team project, with my partner in Texas,
    by experimentation. I have several years of experience using Git and have a
    firm understanding of its theory and actual usage. I use Git for all my
    work.

- UNIX shells

    I use `zsh` as my daily shell, and am familiar with `bash` as well.

- Editors/IDEs

    I have used many text editors and IDEs. The editors which with I am most
    familiar are:

    - Visual Studio
    - Atom and Visual Studio Code
    - Eclipse and NetBeans
    - Vim

## Work Experience

I worked at Rota-Kiwan Scout Reservation over the summers during college, as a
lifeguard and then aquatics director. My responsibilities included:

- Recruiting, interviewing, and hiring staff
- Managing area resources ($30,000 of material and capital assets)
- Maintaining area safety
- Coordinating emergency response with campers, staffers, and emergency services

- Training my staff members
- Enforcing safety protocols for my area and

- Recruiting and training staff
- Maintaining a safe area
- Managing area resources and personnel
- Managing campers
- Coordinating emergency response
- Delivering the customer experience (merit badges and fun) without compromising
safety

I received excellent reviews from the scouts, parents, and my management. My
technical capabilities are largely self-evident, from projects I’ve already done
and through any technical interviews. My abilities as an employee, team member,
and leader are less quantifiable. I can provide references to these effects upon
request.
