# Résumé

## Professional Experience

**Space Dynamics Laboratory:** Logan, UT; December 2016 to present. Satellite
software engineer.

### BioSentinel (NASA Ames Research Center)

For the [BioSentinel] mission, I wrote a network/filesystem kernel
module that enabled communication between the vehicle’s primary computer and an
array of peripheral devices. I designed, formally verified, and implemented the
system in C89. I was responsible for performing software and system integration
tests, and have assisted in the troubleshooting of electrical system faults.

### DARPA/MIT Research Mission

I served as the ground support software developer and mission operator for a
DARPA/MIT research mission for four months. I am not at liberty to disclose
mission specifics. I built our operations platform on the [COSMOS] framework,
and was on the team responsible for our C♯ network processor. I also wrote a
specialized Rust network processor for this mission.

### EAGLE/Mycroft (Air Force Research Laboratory)

I serve as a ground support software developer for the [EAGLE] mission,
working both from our Logan office and directly onsite at Kirtland AFB. I became
the SDL lead developer, and work directly with the AFRL vehicle team to provide
a well-tailored and correct operations program. The software is a web
application written in Python 2.6, and this is my primary working experience
with the Python language and the web2py framework.

## Formal Education

**Trine University:** Angola, IN; August 2011 to May 2016. Computer Engineering
major.

Notable courses:

- ***Senior Design***: My capstone project was the construction and programming
    of an autonomous cargo hauler. I worked with three mechanical engineers on
    the physical machine, and personally built the electrical and software
    systems. The machine capably navigated along a pre-programmed route, and
    successfully detected obstacles such as pedestrians and a train. The code is
    on my GitHub profile, and the summary video is [on YouTube][1]. I can
    provide design documents upon request.

- **Logic and Computer Design**: This class focused on the hardware construction
    of a computer and the instruction primitives executing on it. We built a
    five-stage MIPS CPU in Verilog.

- **Embedded Systems**: This class taught real-time operating systems and
    OS-less programming. We built an oscilloscope and basic RTOS.

- **Software Engineering I and II**: These classes focused on development
    patterns, software design, and algorithm use. We learned C++/Qt and Ruby,
    and built a Rails app and PostgreSQL database.

General courses:

- *Mathematics*: Calculus III, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Graph
    Theory and Combinatorics, Statistics, Random Processes

- *Programming*: Object-Oriented Programming (Java), Application Programming
    (C++/Qt), Computer Security (Java), Net-Centric Computing (PHP, C++),
    Algorithms (C++, Python).

- *Electronic Systems*: Circuit Theory and Analysis, Digital Systems (Verilog),
    Microcontrollers (C, Assembly).

Mechanical Engineering major (two years):

- Static Analysis, Solid Mechanics, Dynamic Systems
- Thermodynamics
- Kinematics and Mechanical Linkages
- Mechatronics

## Skills

I rapidly master development environments, toolchains, and programming
languages. I also readily understand software abstract principles such as
algorithm design, flow of control, design patterns, and behavioral paradigms.

I taught myself the basics of programming and Linux use before switching majors,
and continued to complement my formal education with individual pursuits and
projects. I have continued pursuing education on my own initiative, and am
capable of working with a broad range of languages, tools, and systems.

### Languages

- English: I have an excellent command of English and technical communication.

- Ruby
    {:.cover}

    I taught myself Ruby before taking the computer engineering major, and
    continue to use it as my prototyping language. I am familiar with Ruby on
    Rails, and have written gems for public use. I am currently using Ruby at
    work to drive the ground end of one of our satellite projects.

- Java
    {:.cover}

    I learned the basics of Java in high school, and pursued it further for
    my formal courses in it.

- C, C++
    {:.cover}

    I am most familiar with the language cores, as I did most of my embedded
    work with little or no standard library presence. I am also familiar with
    the Qt framework, and have built both integrated and client/server
    applications using it.

    - AVR Assembly
        {:.cover}

        My embedded classes taught us to use ASM to start our controllers,
        implement base drivers, and hand-optimize certain routines.

- Rust
    {:.cover}

    I investigated using Rust for my Senior Design project. I taught myself Rust
    and am fluent in its core concepts. I have used it for approximately three
    years now, and have published crates demonstrating my knowledge of the
    language and its features. I have also deployed a Rust project for data
    stream processing at work, though I am not at liberty to disclose its code.

- C♯:
    {:.cover}

    I taught myself C♯ and Visual Studio, and have used them to build console
    apps and ASP.NET websites. I have also used the graphical frameworks to
    build applications.

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
    {:.cover}

    I taught myself web design, and volunteered to help my professor teach these
    languages for my Software Engineering classes. I write this site myself, and
    offer it as a testament to my ability.

#### Others

- Bash and Zsh scripting
- Python
- AVR, MIPS, x86 assemblers

### Systems and Tools

- Windows
    {:.cover}

    I’ve used Windows all my life, and have some experience in system
    administration and Windows Server usage. I currently only use Windows at
    work.

- GNU/Linux
    {:.cover}

    I started on Ubuntu, and now run Arch Linux as my daily-use system. I am
    comfortable working with GNU userspace tools on the command line. I have
    written several shell scripts and systemd units for system administration. I
    use Linux both as my desktop system and on my server.

- OSX / macOS
    {:.cover}

    I am comfortable using Macintosh’s graphical and terminal environments.

- Microsoft Office
    {:.cover}

    I have used Word, Excel, and Outlook since elementary school, and am
    proficient in their use. I am skilled with Powerpoint and familiar with
    Access.

- Git
    {:.cover}

    I learned Git the hardest way: on a team project, with my partner in Texas,
    by experimentation. I have several years of experience using Git and have a
    firm understanding of its theory and actual usage. I use Git for all my
    work.

- Command shells
    {:.cover}

    I use Zsh as my daily shell, and am familiar with GNU Bash as well. I use
    PowerShell at work.

- Editors/IDEs
  - Atom and Microsoft Visual Studio Code (not at all related to VS)
  - Basic Vim usage
  - GNU Nano
  - Eclipse and NetBeans
  - Microsoft Visual Studio

## Other Work Experience

### Rota-Kiwan Scout Reservation

I worked at Rota-Kiwan Scout Reservation over the summers during college, as a
lifeguard and then aquatics director. My responsibilities included:

- Recruiting, interviewing, and hiring staff
- Managing area resources ($30,000 of material and capital assets)
- Maintaining area safety
- Coordinating emergency response with campers, staffers, and emergency services
- Training my staff members
- Enforcing safety protocols for my area in particular and the camp in general

I received excellent reviews from the scouts, parents, and my management. My
technical abilities as a lifeguard are, thankfully, untested by real rescue
situations; I attribute this to my abilities as an area director and the
proactive safety work of my team and myself.
