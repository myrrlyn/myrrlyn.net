Introduction
	</h2>
	<p>
I’m a software engineer at Space Dynamics Laboratory, working on embedded
software for satellite missions. I work primarily in C, and have hopes to
introduce the Rust language into aerospace.
	</p>
	</p>
I’m a bigger Taylor Swift fan than you.

Contact Info
	</h2>
	<p>
Feel free to reach me at
<%= link_to "appayne@outlook.com", "mailto:appayne@outlook.com" %>. My cell
number is on some spam lists, so I rarely answer cold calls; I prefer email for
first contact.
	</p>
	<p>
My public key is hosted locally <%= link_to "here", "/myrrlyn.asc" %> and at
<%= link_to "my Keybase profile", "//keybase.io/myrrlyn" %>. Encryption probably
isn’t <em>that</em> important to talk to me, but good habits are good habits.

This site is a work in progress. I would greatly appreciate reports of bugs, and
equally appreciate patience as I build it.
