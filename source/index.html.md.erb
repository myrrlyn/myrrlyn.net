# Home

I’m Alexander Payne, a programmer and lifelong Boy Scout. I currently live in
northern Utah, where I work as a satellite software engineer at Space Dynamics
Laboratory and volunteer with Troop 1.

Because work/life balances are overrated, my primary personal hobbies are
programming (often projects related to work) and exploring the lovely outdoors
Utah has to offer. I also ski and SCUBA dive, and look forward to honing both of
those skills in the near future. Sometimes I take pictures of landscapes I think
are pretty, and use those for the banner pictures.

See my [profile] for more about me, my [résumé] for more about my skills, or my
[portfolio] for more about projects I’ve done.

I use cookies to run the banner image at the top of the page, and to add a
little magic to sidebar menus elsewhere in the site. Cookies have a bad image
nowadays, and while I neither live nor host in the EU where the law mandates I
inform you of these, it’s still good practice.

I don’t offer an option to disable cookies, because remembering that would
require … cookies. The two buttons below will be on almost every page here, and
if you’re really feeling nerdy, you can browse the [source code] for this
website or just open up a console and type `document.cookie` to see that I’m
behaving myself.
